# Python for Beginners, Part III: Almost There, Stick With It

_This is Part 3 in a series (n=?). Part I: Getting Started is [here](https://github.com/markchand/Python-for-Beginners/blob/master/README.md)._ 

Welcome back! If you've completed the setup tasks in Part I, you've created your very first Jupyter notebook. Cool. 

From here on out, we'll be working from within Jupyter Notebooks, rather than this blog. If you haven't done it already, head to GitHub and download the Python-for-Beginners repository (look for the big green button): 

(https://github.com/markchand/Python-for-Beginners)

Drag that folder wherever you want it; mine is in Documents/GitHub. Once you've done that, open Terminal (see Part I if you're lost) and then type this to open the Anaconda environment: 

```
jupyter notebook
```

From there, navigate to your copy of the Python-for-Beginners folder, and click on the Part-4.ipynb file to open up Part IV!
